A collection of extra utilities and extensions to the Elixir standard library.

Extra was extracted from Urbint's internal umbrella application, and should be
considered unfinished, though we are using it internally and developing against
it fairly heavily.

## Installation

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:extra, "~> 0.2.0"}]
end
```
